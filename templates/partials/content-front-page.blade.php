    <h2>Training</h2>
    <p>Our approach to horse training is natural, gentle and individualized to each horse. We start and re-start horses, breaking young horses for riding or for the track, or re-training race horses as hunter-jumpers or event horses. Reading each horse as we go, watching and listening to how it reacts to new challenges, we can customize the pace of training to the particular horse, assuring continual forward progress.</p>
    <p>We value positivity and provide a supportive and encouraging environment. At JohnMel, it’s important to us to integrate the owner or rider into the horse’s training process for a smoother transition, and we remain available for consultation on an ongoing basis.</p>
